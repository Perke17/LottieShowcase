# LottieShowcase
Simple QtLottie viewer application

This should work nicely with Qt 5.13 & the QtLottie module.

To use: build the QtLottie modules, and then build this using the
relevant Qt installation.

The app takes a directory and watches it for .json files. If any 
are in there, or if any are added, then they are added to the combo
box in top right, and can be selected and played in the space in the
center of the app.

Bottom of the app shows rudimentary start/stop/seek controls.

Would be nice to put a little 'Delete' button in the top left area,
just waiting to find a nice lottie animation for delete.
